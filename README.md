## Program Arguments
The program uses several arguments to control the flow of the program.
They are described in this section.

Argument        | Description                                                        | Shorthand | Type    | Default      | Notes
:---            | :---                                                               | :---:     | :---:   | :---         | :---
`--delete`      | Delete files from after downloading or preprocessing them.         | `-e`      | N/A     | False        | 1
`--log`         | Enables debug, or sets the output level.                           | `-l`      | String  | `"info"`     | 2
`--mode`        | Sets the mode the program is run in.                               | `-m`      | String  | `"generate"` | 3
<!-- `--no-download` | Disables downloading after generating files.                       | N/A       | N/A     | False        | N/A -->
`--save-path`   | Where to save files after they've been downloaded or preprocessed. | `-s`      | String  | `"./"`       | N/A
<!-- `--timeout`     | The timeout to wait for downloads to be ready in seconds.          | `-t`      | Integer | None         | 4 -->

### Argument Notes
#### 1. Delete
The delete flag does different things in different modes.  
In the data generation mode (`--mode generate`), this flag ensures files are deleted from the Google Drive account after they have been downloaded.  
In preprocess mode (`--mode preprocess`), this flag deletes the raw images from the disk after they've been preprocessed and saved as a pickle file.  
The flag does nothing in the other two modes.

#### 2. Log
The log flag controls the output level of the console.
Full logs are always written to file.
It knows three different modes:
* If it's not present it defaults the output level to INFO level.
* If present without any value it sets the output level to DEBUG.
* If present with a value it sets the output level to the specified value.

The logging modes are as follows in reverse order of importance: `debug`, `info`, `warning`, `error`, and `critical`.  
If you choose a mode with low importance like INFO, messages of higher importance like ERROR will still be printed.

#### 3. Mode
The mode flag controls the mode the program is run in. Four modes have been implemented.  
The default mode is data generation (`generate`), and uses Google Earth Engine to generate and acquire data files.  
The preprocess mode (`preprocess`) prepares the generated images for use in the neural network.  
The model training mode (`train`) trains a Generative Adversarial Model (GAN) on the acquired data. (not yet implemented)  
The image prediction mode (`predict`) uses a trained model to predict/generate a new image from acquired data. (not yet implemented)

#### 4. Timeout
The timeout flag sets the time to wait for downloads after executing a generate order to the Google Earth Engine servers.
The default value of "None" sets the timeout to three times the number of files generated in minutes.
The value to provide is time in seconds.
